<p align="justify"style="background-color:LightGreen;font-size:18px;">Stella is my best friend from University. We both study in the same course. At first, she didn’t like me and thought that I’m arrogant. Neither did I. Then we started to talk about some kind of things in the circle of friends and understood that we both have similar interests and thoughts. <b>Then we became friends, fortunately</b>. We both think same about everything. Sometimes we even say what we think at the same time and both of us pronounce the same. <i>Yeah, it’s kind of crazy, but we’re like soulmates!</i>  Neither of us like to communicate a lot with people we don’t like or don’t have similar interests, but both of us talk about everything when we are alone. However, neither of us likes to gossip and to be compared. We both like to help people and do our best to be helpful in different situations. But neither of us tolerates when people are ungrateful and don’t appreciate everything that you do for them. It drives us crazy! <u>But it is the reality, so we both are trying to go on and think that we do all by the bottom of our hearts.</u> Also neither of us likes injustice and when it happens, we both do everything to prevent that. We both are sometimes accommodating and want to do everything for each other’s comfort. We both enjoy our company and love each other.
